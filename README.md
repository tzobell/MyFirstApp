Draw music shapes


Use this app to draw different shapes, and then press play to play the picture that you have drawn.

Notes
Notes that can be played correspond to the 88 notes found on a piano. Depending on the shapes drawn, and their relation to other shapes drawn, different notes will be played. Each shape has a circumcircle and an inscribed circle. A Shape drawn all by itself will play the note whose frequency is closest to the ratio of its circumcircle area to inscribed circle area. If a shape is drawn such that its circumcircle fits completely inside of another shapes circumcircle, then that will produce a note with the frequency closest to the ratio of the larger shapes circumcircle area to the smaller shapes circumcircle area. shapes whose circumcircles are connected but not concentric will produce the note with the frequency closest to the radio of the larger shapes diameter to the smaller shapes diameter.  

Drawing
Select from a variety of polygons to draw. If drawing a polygon and its ending point is extended into the bounds of another shape, then that shape will display the various "golden points" at which the endpoint of the shape can be locked into. Golden points are determined using the golden ratio which is equal to (square root(5) +1)/2. If at least one shape has already been drawn on the canvas, then when another shape is drawn, the starting point will automatically lock onto the closest shapes circumcircle, if the ending point is extended to a point on the canvas that is not within the bounds of any existing shapes then the end point will lock onto the point that will make the ratio of its circumcircle's diamater and the circumcircle's diamater  that itâ€™s starting point is on or in (or vise versa) equal to the frequency of a note. If you want to undo the last shape drawn, then select the undo option.
